## Project Proposal - Pension Cotribution Calculator

### Overview

The pension contribution app will be a simple, web-based tool designed to assist colleagues in calculating their pension contributions and remaining pay after this is deducted. The tool will allow colleagues to input their base pay and selected pension percentage to quickly obtain accurate and clear results. This app aims to provide convenience and transparency in financial planning for employees which is not currently available within the business.

### Objective

The aim of this project is to provide colleagues with an easy to use tool which will allow them to have a greater understanding of their pay elements and how the pension scheme works. The hope is that through obtaining this greater understanding colleagues will have a higher propensity to utilise the pension scheme. The target users for this app is all colleagues within British Airways.

### Core Features
- The app will allow users to enter two fields; basic pay and pension %.
- The results will be dynamically updated through clicking the 'CALCULATE' button.
- The app will then return two figures based on these inputs, one for the total contribution and one for the take home pay following this contribution.
- The app will have error checking that will return errors if any of the following conditions are met:
    - The user has not entered a figure for basic pay or pension.
    - The pension % entered is above 50% or below 0%.
    - The pay entered is below 0.

### Technology Stack:
Front End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Hosting: The app will be hosted in github pages for easy deployment and accessibility.
